To be able to use this, you need the following files:
- token.pickle and credentials.json (from gmail so you are able to fetch the shareville emails from your mail)

For the Nordnet API you need nordnet api account and the following files:
- creds.txt (your Norndet api credentials)
- NEXTAPI_TEST_public.pem (from Nordnet api website)

Some parts are in Finnish and some in English.. Sorry for the inconvenience.
